| Soju           |"Traditionally, soju is fermented white rice with a crisp flavor, a little apple, and sometimes a touch of burnt rice." Soju is often called the Korean vodka, since it's smooth, mild, and mostly neutral, but it clocks in at about half the alcohol content.| ![soju](images/soju.png) | 145
